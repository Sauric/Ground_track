# Ground_track
Ground track of trajectory of satellite on the Earth. 

Run Up_to_date2.py for real-time ploting ground track of satellite.

In constants.py, you can vary many parameters such as: the inclination 
of the satellite trajectory relative to the equator, the position and 
size of the area on the sphere (on the ground), with which we want to 
know the time and coordinates of the satellite crossing, the satellite's 
distance from the earth, the angular velocity of the earth.

intersection.py counts the time and coordinates of the intersection of
the satellite track with the selected area on the sphere (on the Earth).
